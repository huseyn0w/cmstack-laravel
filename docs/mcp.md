# LaraPress MCP server (AI connector)

LaraPress ships a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** so an AI client
such as **Claude** (Claude Code CLI, the VS Code extension, or claude.ai) can manage
your **live** site — posts, pages, categories, users, settings, and theme templates —
through scoped, authenticated tools.

It is built on the official [`laravel/mcp`](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/mcp) package
and runs **inside the Laravel app itself** (no separate Node service). Every tool runs
as the OAuth-authenticated admin and is gated by that account's existing LaraPress
permissions. There is **no raw code-execution tool** — the only "code" surface is
editing Blade templates inside the active theme, with strict path allow-listing.

- **Endpoint:** `POST https://<your-site>/mcp/larapress`
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 via Laravel Passport (the MCP-standard mechanism)
- **Transport:** streamable HTTP

---

## What the AI can do (tools)

All tools validate their inputs and return structured results. "Requires X" is the
LaraPress permission the connected account must hold, or the tool returns
*Permission denied*.

| Domain | Tools | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| **Posts** | `list-posts`, `get-post`, `create-post`, `update-post`, `delete-post` | `manage_posts` |
| **Pages** | `list-pages`, `get-page`, `create-page`, `update-page`, `delete-page` | `manage_pages` |
| **Categories** | `list-categories`, `get-category`, `create-category`, `update-category`, `delete-category` | `manage_post_categories` |
| **Users** | `list-users`, `get-user`, `create-user`, `update-user`, `delete-user`, `list-roles` | `manage_users` |
| **Settings** | `get-general-settings`, `update-general-settings`, `get-seo-settings`, `update-seo-settings` | `manage_general_settings` |
| **Theme** | `list-theme-files`, `read-theme-file`, `write-theme-file` | `manage_general_settings` |

Notes:
- **Multilingual content** (posts/pages/categories) takes an optional `locale`
  argument (e.g. `en`, `ru`); omitting it targets the site default language.
- **User passwords** are always hashed; passwords are never returned by any tool.
  The primary admin (id 1) and your own account cannot be deleted.
- **Theme tools** only touch `*.blade.php` files under the active theme
  (`resources/views/<TEMPLATE_NAME>/`). Absolute paths, `..` traversal and
  non-Blade files are rejected. Templates are read/written as text, never executed.

## Server-side setup (one time)

The MCP code is part of the repo. To enable it on a deployment you only need to make
sure Passport is migrated and has keys. (`composer install` already pulls in
`laravel/mcp` and `laravel/passport`.)

```bash
# 1. Run migrations — adds Passport's oauth_* tables
php artisan migrate

# 2. Generate Passport encryption keys (writes storage/oauth-*.key; NOT committed)
php artisan passport:keys
#   On a fresh setup you can instead run: php artisan passport:install

# 3. Make sure APP_URL is your real public https URL — OAuth discovery uses it
#    APP_URL=https://your-site.com   (in .env)

# 4. If you cache config in production, refresh it
php artisan config:clear
```

Requirements / notes:
- **HTTPS is required** for OAuth in any real client.
- The app's `api` auth guard is configured to use Passport (`config/auth.php`).
- Keys live in `storage/` and are git-ignored (`/storage/*.key`). Generate them
  **once per environment**; don't copy a dev key to production.
- The consent screen shown to the admin during authorization is
  `resources/views/mcp/authorize.blade.php` (published, customizable).

### Give an account access

A connecting account must be a user whose **role** has the relevant `manage_*`
permission(s) — exactly the same flags used by the admin panel
(**Admin → Users → Roles**). Create a dedicated "AI automation" role granting only
the capabilities you want the assistant to have, and assign it to the user you'll
authenticate with.

## Connect from Claude

When the client first calls the server it performs the OAuth flow: your browser
opens to LaraPress, you **log in as the admin** and **approve** the connection, and
the client stores the token. Tokens expire (15 days by default; see
`AppServiceProvider`) and refresh automatically.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http larapress https://your-site.com/mcp/larapress
```

Then start Claude and run `/mcp` — choose **larapress → Authenticate** to complete
the OAuth login in your browser. After that you can ask things like
*"list the latest posts"* or *"create a draft page titled About us"*.

### Claude Code (VS Code extension)

The extension reads the same MCP config. Either run the `claude mcp add` command
above in the integrated terminal, or add a `.mcp.json` at your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "larapress": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-site.com/mcp/larapress"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload the window; the extension will prompt you to authenticate on first use.

### claude.ai (web)

Add a **Custom Connector** in Settings and paste the endpoint
`https://your-site.com/mcp/larapress`; complete the OAuth login when prompted.

## Test & debug locally

With the stack running (`make up`) you can exercise the server with the bundled
MCP Inspector:

```bash
php artisan mcp:inspector mcp/larapress
```

Automated tests for authorization and theme-path safety live in
`tests/Feature/Mcp/LaraPressServerTest.php`:

```bash
php artisan test --filter=LaraPressServerTest
```

## How it's wired (for contributors)

- **Route:** `routes/ai.php` — `Mcp::oauthRoutes()` + `Mcp::web('/mcp/larapress', …)`
  behind `auth:api` (Passport) and `throttle:120,1`.
- **Server:** `app/Mcp/Servers/LaraPressServer.php` registers all tools.
- **Tools:** `app/Mcp/Tools/<Domain>/…` — thin classes that validate input and
  delegate to the existing `CPanel*Repository` classes (same code path as the admin
  panel), so business rules and observers are reused rather than re-implemented.
- **Concerns:** `app/Mcp/Concerns/`
  - `AuthorizesAccess` — per-tool permission gate, read from the bearer-token user
    (never the web session).
  - `ResolvesLocale` — validates and applies the request locale for translatable writes.
  - `HydratesRequest` — mirrors validated input onto the global request so the
    request-coupled model observers behave exactly as they do for an admin form post.
  - `ResolvesThemePath` — path allow-listing for the theme-file tools.

To add a capability: create a tool with `php artisan make:mcp-tool`, gate it with
`AuthorizesAccess::deny()`, delegate to a repository, and register it in
`LaraPressServer::$tools`.
